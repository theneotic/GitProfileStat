## ✍️ Coding Style

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode).
- **Styling**: Use the **Airbnb** style guide with the project's Prettier configuration. No trailing spaces, prefer single quotes, and use semicolons.
- **Naming**:
  - Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserCard`).
  - Functions/variables: `camelCase`.
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **React**: Prefer functional components with hooks. Keep components small and reusable.
- **CSS**: Use **CSS Modules** or **styled‑components** as defined in the project. Avoid inline styles.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA attributes and are keyboard navigable.
